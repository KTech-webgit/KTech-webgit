                        Bitcoin has a public ledger which is called the blockchain. The process of mining adds new transactions to this public ledger. Why? Well, Bitcoin users need this process because it means that every transaction is securely confirmed and verified while all the users making use of the Bitcoin network has full access to the blockchain – in other words, the Bitcoin ledger. Mining also helps the network figure out which transactions are fair and legit, eliminating any transactions that try to spend money a second time.

                      </p>
                      <p>So when someone “mines” Bitcoin they are in fact performing a service to all Bitcoin users because they ensure Bitcoin transactions are legitimate. During the process of mining people who mine Bitcoin will complete a new block which means that the miner gets a reward. In 2022 the return for completing a new block was 12.5 Bitcoin, but the reward gets lower with time.
                    </p>
                    <p>As you can imagine, mining requires a lot of hard work and patience – you do not get Bitcoin mining results quickly. So there’s an obvious analogy with actual, physical mining of metals like gold. Hence using the word “mining” for the computational tasks that generate new Bitcoin.
                    </p>
                    <span>Choosing your mining equipment</span>
                  <span class="icon">
                      <i class="icon fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                  </span>
                  <p>Mining Bitcoin involves very complex calculations which are very computationally intensive. So, choosing the right hardware kit when you mine Bitcoin is really essential. You need to think about a number of specific characteristics when you choose your Bitcoin mining kit.

                  </p>
                  <span>Hash rates</span>
                  <span class="icon">
                      <i class="icon fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                  </span>
                   <p>Perhaps the key aspect of your mining kit choice is this: the hash rate that your mining hardware can sustain. Hash rate is basically the number of crypto calculations that your mining hardware can perform every second. It’s easy to see why a higher hash rate will help you mine coins more quickly – simply because more calculations per second mean that you solve the crypto math required to mine a coin much more quickly. As a result you can quickly complete a block and get your reward for doing so.

                   </p>
                   <p>Hash functions work like this: whatever input you insert will always give you the same output. So to find a specific output you have to try as many random inputs as you can – as fast as you can. It makes mining competitive and the miner who can process more inputs than other miners will end up getting rewarded faster. So, again, if you can get hardware with a high hash rate you will have an advantage over other miners which means you get more rewards more quickly.
                </p>
                <p>The rate of measurements for hash rates is MH/sec, which is short for megahashes per second. You can also measure hash rates in terms of GH/sec and TH/sec, standing for giga- and terahashes per second respectively. Bitcoin mining hardware have hash rates which can range from a few hundred MH/sec all the way to 10 TH/sec (or 10,000,000 MH/sec).

                </p>
                <span>Cost of energy</span>
                  <span class="icon">
                      <i class="icon fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                  </span>
                <p>There are costs involved with mining Bitcoin, and it’s not just the physical mining hardware you need to worry about. If you can afford powerful hardware you will quickly find you have another headache: the electricity cost associated with driving that hardware because powerful mining hardware consume a lot of power.

                </p>
                <p>When buying hardware you therefore need a close look at the electricity consumption of the kit – work it out in watts and then see how much it will cost you, so that you don’t get a big surprise when you get your next electricity bill. If you don’t you risk spending all your mining profits on electricity – or indeed face making a big loss.

                </p>
                <p>Hash rate alongside energy consumption is a good way to evaluate mining profits. Compare the hashes you can complete in an hour with the cost of electricity per hour (or per day). An easy way to do this is to divide the hash rate of your kit by the watts consumed. It’ll give you a MH/s per watt rate which can guide you, alongside current electricity costs, to find whether your mining kit will produce a profit.

                </p>
                <p>Don’t forget to include extra costs like the computer hardware that drives mining GPUs when you calculate profits - your PC will also consume power on top of the mining hardware that you have.

                </p>
                <span>Understanding mining pools</span>
                <span class="icon">
                    <i class="icon fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                </span>
                <p>The computer resources required to mine Bitcoin has increased to the extent that successfully mining Bitcoin now requires you to compete against organisations with a lot of money, and which can set up big mining farms. So it is hard to mine solo and one of the ways to improve your ability to mine Bitcoin is for you to join a pool of Bitcoin miners.
                </p>
                <p>When pooling your mining efforts you basically give your computing resources to the collective mining effort so that blocks can be found faster, which means rewards are obtained more quickly. These rewards are then split amongst the people who contribute their computing resources in a way that’s proportional to their contribution. Joining a pool can therefore make your mining income more streamlined as you’ll get paid more quickly – even if the individual payments could be small.
                </p>
               <span> Can you profitably mine Bitcoin? </span>
                <span class="icon">
                    <i class="icon fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                </span>
                <p>The profits you can generate when mining Bitcoin has rapidly changed over the years as Bitcoin itself has become more valuable, while the difficulty of mining Bitcoin has increased exponentially. The early enthusiasts who used CPUs to mine Bitcoin will now no longer be able to make any money out of doing so, instead the game is in the hands of people who operate enterprise-scale mining ventures.
                </p>
                <p>So in essence the easily obtainable Bitcoins were mined long ago so today mining is incredibly hard, like trying to find diamonds. The increasing value and popular appeal of Bitcoin has also drawn a lot of new players into the Bitcoin mining scene which makes the competition for mining new coins even tougher – it means that you simply need more and more powerful computing resources to mine a coin.
                </p>
                <span> Specialised mining gear is now key</span>
                <span class="icon">
                    <i class="icon fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                </span>
                <p>It’s not that you can’t mine – it just means that to make a profit you now need fairly specialised Bitcoin mining gear. Individuals trying to mine will often find that they simply spend more on the electricity they use to mine than what they get in return for mining. In part, access to cheap electricity is key to mining Bitcoin successfully today and so is scale – the ability to put together a very large mining operation.
                </p>
                <p>People who mine at home also need to cope with all sorts of issues ranging from the power going out through to hardware that breaks down and getting disconnected from the internet – not to mention crashed in the price of Bitcoin, which happen occasionally. It really is very difficult for people to mine Bitcoin at home and make any money at all.
                </p>
                <p>That doesn’t mean that the mining at home proposition won’t change: ASICs are becoming better and better while the software that handles the hardware is also becoming more capable. In the future all these factors could change so that individuals can again mine Bitcoin at home – which would be a good thing because it supports the decentralised aspect of Bitcoin. In other words, people mining Bitcoin at home prevents all the power from accumulating with a few large players.
                </p>
                <span> What you need to know about Bitcoin cloud mining</span>
                <span class="icon">
                    <i class="icon fa fa-chevron-right"></i>
                </span>
                <p>There is an alternative to mining Bitcoin using your own equipment. It’s known as cloud mining, and it operates on a principal similar to other cloud services. Instead of owning your own computer equipment you “rent” mining capabilities from someone else. It’s a bit like buying a mining contract and in doing so you will be sharing in the vast computing capabilities of the company you contract with.
                </p>
                <p>Without a doubt Bitcoin cloud mining can be easier than trying to do it with your own hardware because there’s no need to worry about software, internet bandwidth or the cost of electricity. And, of course, you don’t have to pay for the hardware either. All you need is an internet connection and ideally your own Bitcoin wallet to keep your coins locally.

                </p>
                <p>Note though that when you’re outsourcing your mining activity to a cloud mining provider you will take a degree of risk. You hand over almost all control to the cloud mining vendor. That's why choose only reputable cloud mining providers like xpinvestment.
